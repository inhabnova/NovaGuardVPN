When using our app, we may collect the following data: • INHABITR LIMITED does not gather or store any user data. Our service focuses on traffic encryption without maintaining any user logs or records. • Information directly provided by you: We do not collect personal details such as your name, email, phone number, or any other information you might choose to share. Your email address is only used to respond to your queries through our official website or via forms within our mobile application, but it does not allow us to identify users personally. • We collect aggregate data on the total amount of data transmitted by all users across different countries. • We gather statistical information to ensure the quality of our service. While we can access aggregate statistics by region and server, this data cannot be linked back to any specific individual. No data that could uniquely identify a user is stored or maintained. • We do not gather any information about you or your device while you use our app, such as your IP address, device type, operating system version, or the times of access. Importantly, we do not collect browsing history, traffic data, or DNS queries that could be used to trace any individual user. • The app uses third-party services that might collect data capable of identifying you.
